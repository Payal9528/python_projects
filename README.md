# python_projects

A collection of small to medium-sized Python projects, experiments, and utilities. This repository groups standalone projects and learning exercises to demonstrate Python concepts and practical scripts.

## Repository structure

- projects/
  - project-name-1/
  - project-name-2/
  - ...
- scripts/            — small one-file utilities
- notebooks/          — Jupyter notebooks for experiments
- tests/              — shared or example tests
- README.md           — this file

Each project folder generally contains its own README with instructions specific to that project.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Payal9528/python_projects.git
   cd python_projects
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   - macOS / Linux:
     ```
     python3 -m venv .venv
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - Windows (PowerShell):
     ```
     python -m venv .venv
     .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```

3. Install dependencies for a project:
   ```
   cd projects/<project-name>
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the project according to its README (each project should include instructions).

## How to add a new project

1. Create a new folder under `projects/` with a descriptive name.
2. Add a `README.md` inside the new folder describing:
   - Purpose of the project
   - How to install and run
   - Example usage
3. Optionally add `requirements.txt` and tests.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Suggested workflow:
- Fork the repo
- Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
- Add your project or changes
- Submit a pull request with a clear description

Please ensure:
- Project folders are self-contained
- Include a README for each project
- Add tests where appropriate

## License

Specify a license for the repository (e.g., MIT). If you want, I can add a LICENSE file — tell me which license you'd like.

## Contact

If you want to include contact info or a project owner, add it here.

---
If you'd like, I can:
- Create this `README.md` in the repository root now,
- Place it in a specific folder you name,
- Or modify the draft with project-specific descriptions and license details before creating it.

Which would you like me to do next?
